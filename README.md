# Password-Strength-Tester

In this project, the password strength tester collects a password, evaluates its strength on a scale of 0(weak) till 4(Strong). If the strength of the given password is less the 4, it enhances it (by adding extra characters and symbols). It also suggests stronger passwords as examples.
